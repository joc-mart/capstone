            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>I compiled resources from a variety of media including podcasts, books, websites, youtube, and apps. I looked for resources that provide information, tips, and tools that could help someone understand and/or alleviate executive dysfunction. I also looked for resources that help educate about mental health in general. For data collection, I conducted in person interviews with family and friends with executive dysfunction and created surveys using google forms

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>After conducting research, I began the prototype process with a moodboard, then sketches, and chose typefaces and a color palette. Designing for people with executive dysfunction means that the project should be highly engaging, yet not overwhelming. It needs to be easy to read but not boring. I chose designs and colors that make it look cheerful, friendly, and enjoyable to explore. For example, I chose Lexend Deca as the body typeface because it was created specifically to improve reading proficiency.

            <h3>Initial Survey</h3>
                    
            <p>The initial survey was a google form sent online to family, friends, and students. Thank you to Brett Smith who kindly included the survey in an MCAD weekly newsletter. The purpose of the interviews and survey was to get an idea of people&#39s needs and what tools they currently use. 39 people participated in the survey.</p>
                    
            <p>All of the participants reported experiencing at least one of the symptoms of executive dysfunction, with most of them experiencing multiple. While this does not diagnose a person with executive dysfunction, I reason that it does show that tools that would help someone with executive dysfunction would help these participants as well and vice versa.</p>

            <p>The survey also asked what tools and techniques participants use to complete tasks, what they struggle with most with completing tasks, a strength they have, and room for additional comments.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>How to present resources in an accessible and visually appealing way?</p>
            <p>What resources would be helpful? What tools actually work?</p>
            <p>How will the prototype keep the attention of the user?</p>
            <p>What information beyond resources should be included?</p>

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>After a draft of the prototype, I sent out a second survey, again using google forms, for the purpose of user testing.</p> 

            <p>Participants from the initial survey opted in to receive a second survey for further questions. 6 people responded. In this survey, I asked questions to get an idea of the success of the prototype. Is it easy to navigate? Is anything missing? Do they see themselves using the website? Would they recommend it to others? I used the data from the survey to inform changes made to the experience of the website.</p>
