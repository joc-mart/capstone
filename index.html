            <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Executive dysfunction is a set of symptoms including: difficulty with following multiple- step directions, meeting goals, prioritizing tasks, low impulse-control, trouble switching from one activity to another, trouble getting started on tasks, and easily distracted and often forgetful. Some people have executive dysfunction as part of ADHD, or as a result of brain damage, or degenerative brain diseases.</p>
                    
                <p>Common treatments of executive dysfunction are the same as for ADHD: cognitive behavioral therapy and medication. Even with these options, having executive dysfunction can feel isolating. People with these symptoms can feel ashamed, convinced they are being lazy, when in fact they aren&#39t. They want to do things, but their brain is getting in the way. It&#39s hard to talk about mental health struggles and it can feel comforting to see that others have the same experience and see that there are things you can do about it.
